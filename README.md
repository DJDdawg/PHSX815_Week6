# PHSX815_Week6

This week explored Numerical Integation.

**Riemann Sums**

Riemamn sums use rectangles to 

**Trapezoidal Sums**

A trapezoidal sum is simply the average of the left and right Riemann sums. This tends to be a more accurate approximation of the integrals true value than either of the individual Riemann sums. 

**Integration by Quadtratures** 

I won't pretend to understand Quadrature Integration, but there is a scipy package that does it for you. All you need to do is specify the function, lower and upper bounds of the interval, and the order of Quadrature integration you want to use. 

This week's code is in
